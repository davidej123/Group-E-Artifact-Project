      <h1>Record Player</h1>
      <p>
        A record player, also known as a turntable, is a device 
        designed to play vinyl records by converting the physical
        grooves on the disc into audible sound. It offers a rich, 
        analog listening experience that many audiophiles and music
        enthusiasts appreciate for its warm tones and smooth sound.

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        At the center of a record player is the vinyl record itself, 
        which contains music encoded as microscopic grooves. As the
        record spins on the platter, a needle traces these grooves. 
        The needle is attached to a cartridge that converts the
        mechanical vibrations into electrical signals. These signals 
        are then amplified and sent to speakers, producing music.
      </p>
      <p>
        Record players are primarily used for music playback, catering 
        to both casual listeners and serious music fanatics. They
        are also favored by DJs for live performances and mixing, 
        particularly models with direct-drive systems. Beyond
        functionality, record players serve as nostalgic and aesthetic 
        pieces, often appreciated for their vintage appeal and a
        more tactile experience.

            <li>
              <h3>Platter</h3>
              <p>
                Rotates the vinyl at a consistent speed, with two main
                settings: 33â…“ RPM for 12-inch records, and 45 RPM for
                smaller 7-inch records.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Tonearm</h3>
              <p>
                Holds the needle and guides it across the record surface.
                The tonearm can be lifted manually to start and stop playback,
                as well as to seek to a position on the record. The tonearm uses
                a cueing mechanism to slow its descent, in order to prevent 
                damage to the record.

              <h3>Needle & Cartridge</h3>
              <p>
                Reads the grooves on the vinyl and converts them into 
                audio signals. The vibrations felt by the needle are converted
                into an audio signal that can be amplified and played back live.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Audio Connection</h3>
              <p>
                Sends converted audio signals to a speaker or other audio device 
                for easy playback.
