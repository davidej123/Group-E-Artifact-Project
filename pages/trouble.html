      <h2>Common Problems</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>No sound coming from speakers</h3>
          <p>
            Make sure that all cables are securely connected, the volume is turned up,
            and the speakers are powered on. Check if the turntable is properly
            connected to an amplifier or receiver if your system requires one. Also,
            ensure that the correct input source is selected on your amplifier or receiver.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Turntable is not spinning</h3>
          <p>
            Ensure that the power is on and that the platter is
            properly seated on the spindle. If it's a belt-drive
            model, check if the belt is intact and correctly positioned.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Sound distorted or skipping</h3>
          <p>
            Distortion or skipping can be caused by a dirty needle,
            a warped record, or improper tracking force. Make sure
            your needle is clean, the record is in good condition,
            and the tracking force is set according to the manufacturer's
            recommendations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Humming or buzzing noise</h3>
          <p>
            A humming sound can be due to grounding issues. Make sure
            your turntable is properly grounded, and check all cable
            connections to ensure they are secure. A buzzing noise may also
            indicate interference from other electronic devices; try moving
            your turntable away from such devices.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Tonearm moving in an incorrect fashion</h3>
          <p>
            If the tonearm is not moving smoothly or is misaligned,
            check that it is properly balanced and that the anti-skate
            settings are correctly adjusted. Refer to your turntable's
            manual for specific instructions on balancing the tonearm.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Pitch or speed isn't correct</h3>
          <p>
            If the pitch or speed of the record sounds off, ensure
            that the turntable is set to the correct speed (33â…“ or 45 RPM)
            for the record being played. Additionally, check for any mechanical
            issues that may be affecting the motor or platter rotation.
