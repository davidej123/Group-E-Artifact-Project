      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Do I need to connect my own speakers?</h3>
          <p>
            Some record players come with built-in speakers, while others
            require external speakers to output sound. Check your model's
            specifications to see if it has built-in speakers or not.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>What's the difference between belt-drive and direct-drive turntables?</h3>
          <p>
            Belt-drive turntables use a rubber belt to spin the platter,
            which helps reduce vibration and motor noise. Direct-drive
            turntables have the motor directly connected to the platter,
            which yields a more consistent speed and torque, which is often
            preferred by DJs.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Can I connect my record player to Bluetooth speakers?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, if your turntable has Bluetooth output. Otherwise, you'll 
            need a Bluetooth transmitter to connect to Bluetooth speakers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>How do I determine what speed to use for my records?</h3>
          <p>
            Most LPs play at 33â…“ RPM, singles at 45 RPM, and some older 
            records at 78 RPM. Check the size of the record or the 
            label on your vinyl for the correct speed.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Why does my record sound distorted or skip?</h3>
          <p>
            Distortion or skipping can be caused by a dirty needle,
            a warped record, or improper tracking force. Make sure
            your needle is clean, the record is in good condition,
            and the tracking force is set according to the manufacturer's
            recommendations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Why isn't my turntable spinning?</h3>
          <p>
            Ensure that the power is on and that the platter is
            properly seated on the spindle. If it's a belt-drive
            model, check if the belt is intact and correctly positioned.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Why is there a humming sound?</h3>
          <p>
            A humming sound can be due to grounding issues. Make sure
            your turntable is properly grounded, and check all cable
            connections to ensure they are secure.
