      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Do I need to connect my own speakers?</h3>
          <p>
            Some record players come with built-in speakers, while others
            require external speakers to output sound. Check your model's
            specifications to see if it has built-in speakers or not.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>What's the difference between belt-drive and direct-drive turntables?</h3>
          <p>
            Belt-drive turntables use a rubber belt to spin the platter,
            which helps reduce vibration and motor noise. Direct-drive
            turntables have the motor directly connected to the platter,
            which yields a more consistent speed and torque, which is often
            preferred by DJs.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Can I connect my record player to Bluetooth speakers?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, if your turntable has Bluetooth output. Otherwise, you'll 
            need a Bluetooth transmitter to connect to Bluetooth speakers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>How do I determine what speed to use for my records?</h3>
          <p>
            Most LPs play at 33⅓ RPM, singles at 45 RPM, and some older 
            records at 78 RPM. Check the size of the record or the 
            label on your vinyl for the correct speed.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Can I play modern records on vintage turntables?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, most vintage turntables can play modern records as long
            as they support the correct speeds (33⅓ and 45 RPM). However,
            be cautious with 78 RPM records, as not all vintage turntables
            support that speed. Also, ensure the stylus is compatible with the 
            groove size of the record.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>How often should I clean my records and stylus?</h3>
          <p>
            It's recommended to clean your records every week or two
            to maintain sound quality. The stylus should be cleaned
            regularly, ideally after every 10-20 hours of playback, 
            depending on usage and environment.
